# Data and scripts for "Successive extreme climatic events lead to immediate, large-scale, and diverse responses from fish in the Arctic."
This repository contains all data and scripts used to analyse and plot fish species response to multiple ECE in the Barents Sea, 
as done in the paper accepted in Global Change Biology. (Link to the arcticle will soon be available)

The data are aggregated results from the joint the joint Norwegian-Russian (Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR) 
and the Knipovichâ€™s Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography (PINRO, since 2019 - 
Polar Branch of Russian Federal Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography) ecosystem surveys designed to monitor the entire Barents Sea 
each year during summer-autumn between 2004 and 2017. More details about this survey can be found in the publication and in the paper by 
[Eriksen et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661117300642)

We share here:
- Heat and freshwater content for the upper water column in the representative polygons  and whole map of Figure 1 and 2b and c.
- Sea ice data that are used in the analysis (extracted from 
[open access database](https://nsidc.org/data/search/#keywords=sea+ice/sortKeys=score,,desc/facetFilters=%257B%257D/pageNumber=1/itemsPerPage=25)) (Figure 1 and 2a)
- Species traits (from [Beukhof et al.,](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.900866)), 
habitat preferences (from [Husson et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/fog.12493)), 
and yearly time series of average and variance in species responses 
(density, mode of longitude, mode of latitude, geographical extent) (Figure 3a, and figure 4)
- Scaled (kernel density) abundances of functional groups over the sampling area (Figure 3b,c,d)
- Scripts to do the analyses and plots mentioned above

Raw data from the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea is available through the [Norwegian Marine Data Centre](https://www.nmdc.no/nmdc/datasets), 
see [here](https://www.hi.no/en/hi/nettrapporter/rapport-fra-havforskningen-en-2021-15) 
for indications on how to extract the data in english).

We wish you a good exploration!
